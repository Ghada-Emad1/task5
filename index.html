         who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs
         who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not
        disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in
        particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In
        fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly
        helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers, 100% recommend!"
